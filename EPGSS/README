INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

1. Unpack the ZIP file into a directory of your choice.

2. Setup in epgss.ini:
- What grabber would you like to use (currently, only a grabber for media.dir.bg is available, but you can write your own)
- What formatter you would like to use (XMLTV, MXF, or your own's...)

3. For Windows 7 MCE:
- Compile a task in Task Scheduler, which
-- Runs the epgss process a few times per week
-- Calls MCE's LoadMXF utility to import in MCE the MXF file generated by epgss

RUNNING
=======
3. Run with "epgss <output-file>"
